📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting the language of a given text input using Machine Learning models. Language detection plays a vital role in applications like search engines, translation systems, chatbots, and social media monitoring.

The model is trained on a multilingual dataset and can classify text into different languages based on linguistic features.

🚀 Features

Detects language of any given text.

Supports multiple languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Hindi, etc. — based on dataset).

Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Machine Learning models such as Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM are explored.

Flask/Streamlit-based web interface for user interaction (optional).
